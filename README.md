A functioning Agent Based Model (ABM) with criminal network dynamics.
The given model uses the mesa library to handle the agents.
In addition, this model tries to use economic, cultural, and physical aspects to model real-world behaviour of criminal networks and their growth.
In the current stage, this model is in a functioning Beta stage, meaning it is functioning but would require refinement and clean-up.
